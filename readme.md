## Service and API to provide a facade for a postcode / geolocation lookup

The current implementation of this service uses http://postcodes.io/ and only supports UK postcodes.

The API only exposes the ability to look up the geolocation of a postcode and find the nearest postcodes to a given longitude and latitide.
